1) What is a variable?



2) Are variable names case-sensitive? Is a variable named a the same as a variable named A?



3) What characters are you allowed to use in a variable name?



3) Can a variable that originally holds a string hold a different type later on?



4) Can you save the contents of one variable to another? Example:
    x = 5
    y = x
   What is the value of y?



5) Does using the variable in an operation cause the variable's value to change? How can you cause a variable's value
    to change?



6) Why do we use variables, what is their purpose?



7) What is the difference between a literal and a variable?



8) Why are we allowed to write the code x = x + 5, when in math this would be a contradiction?
